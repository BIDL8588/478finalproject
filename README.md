#Password “Cracking” Science (Synthetic Only)

This project will examine the strength of synthetic passwords by hashing and attempting to crack them offline(brute-force or dictionary). The overall goal of this project is to understand the weakness of passwords and compare which password provides more resistance to the different hashing algorithms.
