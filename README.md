#Password “Cracking” Science (Synthetic Only)

This project will examine the sternght of synethic passwords by hashing and attempting to crack this offline(brute-force or ditioncary). The overall goal of tihs project is to understand the weakness of passwords and compare which passwrod provides more resistance to the different hashing algorithms.
